                        onu Sharma is the founder of the 'DYNAMIC INDIA GROUP', which he founded in (1982). (INDIA) He is a well-known author, educator, business consultant, and good businessman, and he is in high demand as a keynote speaker. Today, he is considered one of India's most promising motivational speakers. For people to reach their ultimate capacity, he motivates and supports them. He has carried his lively personal words to people on the other side of the world from where he lives. He has spent the last 17 years researching and comprehending the Direct Sales Industry, and he has helped numerous firms go on the road to success and satisfaction. Success is not just about accumulating wealth; it is also about having your children look up to you as role models. I've viewed a number of his videos and attended a few of his live lectures. His videos and workshops really transformed my life. He's most likely never been here before. In one of his films, he states that in order to reach your goals, you must provide a decent dosage of nutrition to both your mind and your body.
